# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for security reports.

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting (Security Advisories) for this
repository. Include:

- impact
- reproducible steps
- affected versions or commit ranges
- mitigation ideas (if any)

## Response Expectations

This project does not provide a formal SLA. Reports are reviewed as capacity
allows. Valid vulnerabilities will be patched and disclosed in release notes.
